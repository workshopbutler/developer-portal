# Getting Started

!!! info
    Current version: 0.4.0

    Repository: [https://github.com/workshopbutler/themes](https://github.com/workshopbutler/themes)

There are five default themes, supported by Workshop Butler: Alfred, Britton,
Dacota, Hayes, and Gatsby. The themes suit all types of clients, customisable to
some extent and are used for on our hosted pages, [WordPress plugin](../wordpress/index.md),
and JS widgets.

To make the development of our backend system, the WordPress plugin, the JS widgets and
the themes themselves less interconnected, we branched out the themes, and deploy them
separately.

## How They Look

## Creating a Custom Theme
Both our WordPress plugin and JS widgets support custom themes. You can
change the layout and styles of all pages.

We are developers and understand the value of good development environment. That is why
we created an easy-to-use project which you can clone and set up in a few minutes.
