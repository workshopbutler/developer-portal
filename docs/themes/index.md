# Getting Started

There are five default themes, supported by Workshop Butler: Alfred, Britton,
Dacota, Hayes, and Gatsby. The themes suit all types of clients, customisable to
some extent and are used for on our hosted pages, [WordPress plugin](../wordpress/index.md),
and JS widgets.

## Creating a Custom Theme
Both our WordPress plugin and JS widgets support custom themes. You can
change the layout and styles of all pages.

The creation of a custom theme is a simple process. [Follow this guide](../widgets/custom/theme.md) to get started.
