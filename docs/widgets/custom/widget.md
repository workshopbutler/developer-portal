# Widget Customisation

Sometimes you need to change a behaviour of [one of the existing widgets](../index.md) or create a new one. There is no 
support for extensions right now. You have three paths to follow:

1. [Open a ticket](https://github.com/workshopbutler/js-widgets) and request the functionality
1. [Create a pull request](https://github.com/workshopbutler/js-widgets). We recommend to open a ticket first to start a discussion. 
1. Clone or fork [the repo](https://github.com/workshopbutler/js-widgets) and create your own version of the widgets

If you choose the second or the third path, check [Theme Customisation](theme.md) to learn how to launch a development
server.
