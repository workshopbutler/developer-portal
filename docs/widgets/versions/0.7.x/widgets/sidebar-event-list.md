# Sidebar Event List

This widget renders the list of events for your account in a layout, friendly for sidebars.

| **eventPageUrl** | string | | A relative path to a page with a configured [EventPage](event-page.md) widget. This path is used to make an URL to the event page. For example, with `#!js eventPageUrl='/event-details.html'`, an URL for the event with `id=1` will be `#!js /event-details.html?id=1`

| **templateUrl** | string || URL to a file containing a [Nunjucks template](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) for event in the list. Use it during the development only as it significantly reduces the speed of content rendering. |

| **excludeId** | int || Exclude an event with the ID from the list. For example, to exclude a current event from the list of upcoming events on the event page. <br>To use it on [an event page](event-page.md), use a helper to retrieve the ID of the trainer:<br>`#!js WorkshopButlerWidgets.getQueryParam('id')` |
